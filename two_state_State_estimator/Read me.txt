"Safety aware model-based reinforcement learning for optimal control of a class of output-feedback nonlinear systems"

For two state systems

Run

1. Run main_SE_MBRL_final.m to generate data/mat files. 
2. Run BTMBRLSE_GPOPS_preSim.m then GPOPS_comparison.m to generate 
   GPOPS comparison results/mat files. 
3. Use plots_Automatica_MBRL_SE.m to generate plots for ArxiV submission. 


To customize markers:  f_nummarkers.m has been used. 

Necessary notations are provided in the mainbody of the code, the mathematics
can be found in arXiv:2110.00271 submission.
